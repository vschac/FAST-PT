FAST-PT is a code to calculate quantities in cosmological perturbation theory
at 1-loop (including, e.g., corrections to the matter power spectrum). The code
utilizes Fourier methods combined with analytic expressions to reduce the
computation time to scale as N log N, where N is the number of grid points in
the input linear power spectrum.

NOTE: v3.1.0 and earlier require numpy version < 1.24. This is fixed in v3.1.1 and later, which is available on pip and conda.

Easy installation with pip:

* `pip install fast-pt`
* Note: use `--no-deps` if you use a conda python distribution, or just use conda installation

Easy installation with conda:

* `conda install fast-pt`

Full installation with examples:

* Make sure you have current version of numpy, scipy, and matplotlib
* download the latest FAST-PT release (or clone the repo)
* install the repo: `python -m pip install .`
* run the most recent example: `cd examples && python3 v4_example.py`
* for old examples run: `cd examples && python3 fastpt_example.py`
* hopefully you get a plot!

Our papers (JCAP 2016, 9, 15; arXiv:1603.04826) and (JCAP 2017, 2, 30; arXiv:1609.05978)
describe the FAST-PT algorithm and implementation. Please cite these papers
when using FAST-PT in your research. For the intrinsic alignment
implementation, cite PRD 100, 103506 (arXiv:1708.09247).

FAST-PT is under continued development and should be considered research in
progress. FAST-PT is open source and distributed with the
