FAST-PT Documentation
====================

FAST-PT is a code to calculate quantities in cosmological perturbation theory at 1-loop (including, e.g., corrections to the matter power spectrum). The code utilizes Fourier methods combined with analytic expressions to reduce the computation time to scale as N log N, where N is the number of grid points in the input linear power spectrum.

FASTPT is a numerical algorithm to calculate 1-loop contributions to the matter power spectrum and other integrals of a similar type. The method is presented in papers arXiv:1603.04826 and arXiv:1609.05978. Please cite these papers if you are using FASTPT in your research.
