<p>This document details the changes between the original FAST-PT implementation and the current version.</p>
<p>For previous versions’ changes, see the <a class="reference download internal" download="" href="_downloads/1abe55494b10c89f9d07e5e5009d7c70/usr_manual.pdf"><code class="xref download docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">complete</span> <span class="pre">changelog</span> <span class="pre">history</span></code></a>.</p>
<p>NOTE: FAST-PT 4.0 is completely backwards compatible with FAST-PT 3.0. However, adjustments to your code may be required to take advantage of the new features and performance improvements.</p>
<section id="major-changes">
<h2>Major Changes<a class="headerlink" href="#major-changes" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Caching: FAST-PT now caches individual terms and intermediate calculations to speed up computation.</p></li>
<li><p>FPTHandler: The handler class has been introduced to improve the the user’s ability to manage FAST-PT and provide many new convenience features that compliment the FAST-PT class. NOTE: the FPTHandler class is not a replacement for the FAST-PT class, but rather a wrapper that provides additional functionality. It is not necessary for computation.</p></li>
<li><p>To_do list: The to_do list is no longer needed to initialize FAST-PT. The terms will now be calculated as needed and stored as a property of the FAST-PT class.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="minor-changes">
<h2>Minor Changes<a class="headerlink" href="#minor-changes" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Simple flag: A new “simple” kwarg has been added to FAST-PT which will instead initialize an instance of FAST-PT simple.</p></li>
<li><p>Private k: The input k is now “private” after initialization via Python’s name mangling. This means that the user cannot change the value of k after initialization but can still access the value of k.</p></li>
<li><p>Gamma functions cache: A seperate (and simpler) caching system has been implemented to cache gamma functions and save time on the calculation of the X terms, previously stored in the to_do list.</p></li>
<li><p>Parameter validtion: The parameters P, P_window, and C_window are now validated at every function call to ensure that they have the proper traits needed for the calculation. This is done to prevent errors from propagating through the code and causing issues later on.</p></li>
<li><p>N_pad default: If no n_pad is provided during initialization, the default value is now set to 0.5 * len(k). This is done to prevent errors from propagating through the code and causing issues later on.</p></li>
<li><p>Nu deprecation: The nu parameter is now deprecated as it is no longer needed for initialization. It will default to -2 unless a different nu value is needed in which case it will be calculated internally.</p></li>
<li><p>One_loop_dd return: One_loop_dd will only return P_1loop, Ps. Previously returned the dd_bias terms as well however this was contingent on the to_do list which is being deprecated.</p></li>
<li><p>Cleft_QR: The Cleft_QR function has been removed due to missing internal functions.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="performance-improvements">
<h2>Performance Improvements<a class="headerlink" href="#performance-improvements" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The improvement in performance of FAST-PT is going to varry largely with your use case. However, about half of the calculation done for most terms was redundant granting a two times speedup do to the new caching system.
FAST-PT also now calculates terms in a modular format. This means that the user can now choose to calculate only the terms they need, rather than all of the terms grouped into one FAST-PT function.
This is done by using the FPTHandler class and the get method, or by calling compute_term with the necessary parameters for each term.
This will greatly improve the performance of each FAST-PT function if your use case only requires a select few terms.</p>
</section>
<section id="description-of-caching-system">
<h2>Description of Caching System<a class="headerlink" href="#description-of-caching-system" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Caching in Fast-PT is done via a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jablazek/FAST-PT/tree/master/fastpt/core/CacheManager.py">CacheManager</a> object that is initialized with the FAST-PT class. This cache tracks various different “layers” of the calculation of Fast-PT terms. These layers include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Individual Power Spectra: Fast-PT functions return a tuple of multiple power spectra, each of which is cached individually.</p></li>
<li><p>Jk Scalar and Tensor Calculations: Most Fast-PT terms require the calculation of the Jk scalar or tensor functions. Some terms have identical parameters that are passed to these functions, so they are cached individually as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Fourier Coefficients: Within the JK functions, fourier coefficients are calculated. These coefficients are dependant on the user’s inputted power spectrum therefore caching will be beneficial when multiple terms are requested with the same power spectrum.</p></li>
<li><p>Convolutions: This is the “lowest level” of Fast-PT calculations where the actual FFT is performed. The convolution function is called with fourier coefficients as parameters, therefore they are also dependant on the user inputted power spectrum and cached individually.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This multi-tiered caching system allows Fast-PT to avoid redundant calculations both on individual power spectra terms and the intermediate calculations that are needed to compute them.
To avoid the cache from growing too large, a “dump_cache” flag is provided in initialization that, when True, will clear the cache when a new power spectra is inputted by the user. The user is also able to specify (during Fast-PT initialization) a maximum cache size in mb. This will evict cached items randomly (in linear time) to avoid slowing down the total computation time. However, the cache size limit is meant as a safeguard and should not be treated as a form of memory management for the program.</p>

<section id="additional-notes">
<h2>Additional Notes<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-notes" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The 1loop term (one_loop_dd[0]) currently does not pass np.allclose with FAST-PT 3 when a C_window of 0.63 or less is provided. The maximum absolute difference is on the order of 1e-8 and the maximum relative difference is on the magnitude of 1e-4. This bug is currently being investigated and will be fixed in a future release.</p></li>
